# Synopsis

This is code that can build undirected graphs with integer node values and double edge values.
Randomized graphs can be built based on supplied parameters for density, number of nodes, and range
of edge weights.

It includes an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm that will find the shortest path from a supplied
starting node to every other node in the graph, provided that node is connected to the starting node.

# Motivation

This code was completed as part of a coursera course called "C++ for C Programmers" and was written
mostly for personal practice and enjoyment.
